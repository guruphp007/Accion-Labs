I have developed MVC architecture.

By default, the Palindrome controller is called.

To view the page go to http://localhost/accionlabs/project/

To view Palindrome function in browser, Go to http://localhost/accionlabs/project/palindrome

To view Reverse function in browser, Go to http://localhost/accionlabs/project/reverse

To fetch weather info & store it in DB. Follow the steps below
1. Go to this url -> http://localhost/accionlabs/project/weather/save?q=London,uk
2. Change city whatever you want.
3. All the weather information are stored in "weather_info" table

SQL file is located in "database_backup" folder.

Thanks.
